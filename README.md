# void-stranger-ap
Archipelago integration for Void Stranger

## How to install this
Well for now its not actually done but if it were...

Drop the voidstranger.apworld file into your Archipelago\custom_worlds folder

At most this will let you generate multiworlds that include void stranger, not that you could play them since I havent finished modding the game. 

xdelta file coming soon...
