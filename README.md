# void-stranger-ap
Archipelago integration for Void Stranger

## How to install this
Well for now its not actually done but if it were...

Drop the voidstranger.apworld file into your Archipelago\custom_worlds folder

replace the data.win your void stranger uses (found in SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Void Stranger for steam users) with the vsap.win file (be sure to rename it to data.win)
once this is done I'll properly provide an xdelta patch instead but for now you can take a look at the .win file I'm working with if you have UMT

At most this will let you generate multiworlds that include void stranger, not that you could play them since I havent finished modding the game.
