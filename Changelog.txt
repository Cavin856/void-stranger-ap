KNOWN MAJOR ISSUES:
	Currently, Waypoints do not properly restore Mon Bank values
	This will be fixed in the v0.9.2.0 major update



v0.9.1.0
	General:
		New file "ap_room_name.csv" is now required
		
	Waypoints Menu:
		New AP Menu Page
		Three waypoint slots which can be set and then warped to at any time for convenience
		Stores locust count and floor, restoring both on warp
		Can only save waypoint on numbered branes
		Each brane has a unique WIP name/description
	
	Debug Menu:
		New AP Menu Page
		Displays several internal variables
		Should be helpful debugging
		If items aren't being received, are wiped, or you disconnect randomly, send a screenshot of the debug screen to the discord
	
	Connection Menu:
		Now raises errors and prevents connection if AP files are missing (instead of crashing)
		Input fields now allow strings longer than game width, up to 100 characters
		Added end-of-line indicator
	
	Tracker Menu:
		Added (temporary) counter for Greed Coins
	
	Bugfixes:
		End Run now resets (some) AP values
		
	Misc:
		Changed version number format

		Misc formatting adjustments to Yaml descriptions
		ShortcutCheating now functions independant of Locustsanity
		Certain invalid option combinations now raise errors before generation
	
	Tan:
		Burden Chest 3 is now sent when killing Tan, rather than opening the chest
